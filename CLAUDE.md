# Storey — Project Instructions for Claude

## Before making ANY change, think through side effects first

Before executing, ask yourself:
- Does this affect **both web (Vercel) AND Android (Capacitor)**?
- Does this work across **all three envs**: localhost · Vercel preview · storeyinfra.com?
- If touching build config — will assets still load on the web server?
- If touching auth — does it work for Google OAuth, invite flow, AND SMS OTP?
- If touching routing — does the hash router vs real-path split still work?
- If touching RLS or DB — does every role still get the right data?

State the risks out loud before pushing. Don't fix one thing and break another silently.

## Working Discipline (rules — apply every session)

These exist because past sessions shipped large amounts of untested code and let
v1 scope quietly expand. Claude must hold the line on these; the owner (Karun)
should expect Claude to enforce them even when not reminded.

### Engineering discipline
1. **Build → test → commit, in small steps.** Never batch many untested features.
2. **A green build is NOT a tested feature.** "It compiles" ≠ "it works." Each
   feature needs a real run-through before the next one starts.
3. **End every phase with a verification step**, not just a build. If it can't be
   verified now (e.g. needs the live app), say so explicitly and add a TODO.
4. **After a migration**, confirm it applied and the affected screen still works
   before moving on.
5. **One change in flight at a time.** Finish (build + test + commit) before starting the next.

### Scope control
First, **classify every request** — they are not all "scope creep":
- **Bug fix** — something built is broken. Always in scope.
- **Hardening / checks & balances** — adding a control, approval, audit trail or
  validation to a feature that *already exists* (e.g. "attendance now needs
  manager confirmation"). This is legitimate v1 work — it makes v1 sturdier, in
  line with the "integrity and sturdiness" philosophy. Not scope creep.
- **New feature** — a net-new capability/module that didn't exist (e.g. the Task
  module, offline mode, on-site photos). This *is* scope and must be tagged.

Rules:
1. **Define "done" before starting** — for *any* of the three. Write the one-line
   acceptance check first.
2. **When a new "also…" request appears mid-feature, write it to `docs/TODO.md`
   — do not build it now.** Finish the current thing first.
3. **Tag new *features* (only): v1 / v1.x / v2.** Don't silently grow v1 with
   net-new modules. Hardening and bug fixes don't need a version tag — but they
   still need rule 1 and a test.
4. **A change is not done until a real user has tested it** — feature *or*
   hardening. "Built" and "shipped" are different states.
5. Prefer **shipping a smaller verified thing** over a larger unverified one.

### Building technical depth (for the owner)
1. **Skim every file Claude writes or changes.** Don't approve a change you
   can't explain back in one plain sentence.
2. **Learn the 5 load-bearing concepts of this stack**, one at a time:
   React components/state · Supabase RLS · SQL migrations · git basics
   (branch/commit/push/pull) · Capacitor (web vs native).
3. **Keep a running "things I didn't understand" note**; ask Claude to explain
   one per session.
4. **git first** — it has caused real confusion. Learn: what a branch is, what
   commit/push/pull do, what a worktree is. Ask for a walkthrough.
5. When Claude proposes an approach, **ask "what breaks if this is wrong?"**
   before approving — that one question builds judgement fastest.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Zustand + React Router (hash router via `createHashRouter`)
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + RLS + Edge Functions + Auth)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor (Android)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (web), GitHub → Vercel CI/CD

## Environment facts — things that have burned us before

### Vite / Build
- `base` must be `'/'` on Vercel (web server, absolute paths needed)
- `base` must be `'./'` on Android (Capacitor uses `file://`, needs relative paths)
- Use `process.env.VERCEL ? '/' : './'` to switch automatically
- Never use `rewrites: [{ source: "/(.*)" }]` in vercel.json — it catches `/assets/*` too
- Always use `{ "handle": "filesystem" }` first in Vercel routes, then the fallback

### Routing
- App uses `createHashRouter` — all in-app routes live at `/#/path`
- OAuth callback comes in as a real path: `/auth/callback?code=...` (no hash)
- `main.jsx` intercepts `/auth/callback` BEFORE React mounts and exchanges the PKCE code
- While intercepting, React is NOT mounted — inject DOM spinner manually if needed
- The `AuthCallback` component in the router is for `/#/auth/callback` (currently unused)

### Auth / Supabase
- PKCE verifier is stored in `localStorage` per origin
- `storeyinfra.com` and `www.storeyinfra.com` are DIFFERENT origins = different localStorage
- Always canonicalise to `www.storeyinfra.com` at boot (see `main.jsx`)
- `profiles` table has NO `email` column — use `get_auth_user_id_by_email` RPC to look up by email
- `handle_new_user` trigger creates profile with `role='contractor'`, `tenant_id=NULL` for new users
- `link_owner_to_tenant` trigger sets `tenant_id` after a tenant row is inserted
- Google OAuth contractors land with `tenant_id=NULL` — redirect them to `/create-company`
- `onAuthStateChange` fires `INITIAL_SESSION` immediately — skip it to avoid double `fetchProfile`

### Roles (in order of permission level)
```
superadmin > contractor > site_manager > supervisor > store_keeper
```
- `contractor` with `tenant_id = null` → must go through `/create-company` onboarding
- All RLS policies use `my_tenant_id()` and `my_role()` SECURITY DEFINER helpers

### Supabase project
- Project ref: `zgvbogxibiilnblmuohg`
- URL: `https://zgvbogxibiilnblmuohg.supabase.co`
- Allowed redirect URLs include both `storeyinfra.com/auth/callback` and `www.storeyinfra.com/auth/callback`
- Edge functions: `sign-up-with-invite`, `verify-sms-otp`, `send-sms-otp`

### Edge functions — known issues fixed
- `sign-up-with-invite`: use `get_auth_user_id_by_email` RPC (not `profiles.email` — column doesn't exist)
- `verify-sms-otp`: use `SITE_URL` env var for `redirectTo`, not a hardcoded domain

## Deployment checklist before pushing

- [ ] Does `vite.config.js` base work for web AND Android?
- [ ] Does `vercel.json` serve static assets before falling back to `index.html`?
- [ ] Are all new routes added to `router/index.jsx` AND guarded with the right `RoleGuard`?
- [ ] Does the change work when `tenant_id` is null (new contractor)?
- [ ] Are edge functions deployed after changes? (`npx supabase functions deploy <name> --project-ref zgvbogxibiilnblmuohg`)
- [ ] Is any new SQL function/trigger needed in the DB?

## Vendor Module — Policy Decisions (DO NOT OVERRIDE)

### Phase 1 (build now — next 10 days)
- Vendor module lives INSIDE the contractor app only
- **Contractor adds vendors manually** — fills in vendor details themselves
- No vendor self-registration in Phase 1 at all
- No vendor login in Phase 1
- Contractor owns and manages all vendor data (documents, catalogue, assignments)

### Phase 2 (BLOCKED until Phase 1 is battle-tested with 10+ contractors)
- Independent vendor portal (vendor gets their own login)
- **Vendor self-registration = request only** — vendor submits registration request
- **Only superadmin can approve** vendor registration — contractor cannot approve
- Superadmin reviews on `/admin/vendors` → approves or rejects
- Only after superadmin approval is the vendor active and visible to contractors
- No open/public auto-approval — prevents data pollution
- Also unlocks: own profile, catalogue, geo-tagging, public directory

### Vendor registration flow (Phase 2 only)
```
Vendor fills public registration form (no login needed) →
  vendors row created with status = 'pending_approval' →
  superadmin sees pending list on /admin/vendors →
  superadmin approves → status = 'approved' →
    vendor gets login credentials
    vendor becomes discoverable by contractors
  superadmin rejects → status = 'rejected' → vendor notified with reason
```

### RLS rule for vendors
- `pending_approval` vendors: superadmin only (contractors cannot see or action)
- `approved` vendors: visible to all contractors (not tenant-scoped — shared directory)
- Vendor data linked to a contractor only via `vendor_connections` table
- Vendor data NEVER writable by contractors — read only after connection
